## Portfolio - CSS and HTML Practice

**Project:** Use HTML and CSS to Create a Portfolio

**Goal of this Project:** Develop and hone HTML and CSS skills through the creation of a skeleton portfolio page.

**Created by:** Ellen Buelow

**Directions:** Please take a look at the 'Home' page where I describe a little bit about myself, the 'contact' page where you can leave your name, email, and a message for me (not yet functioning), and the portfolio page. I hope to use the portfolio page in the future to add project work and the link to the code on GitHub.

More to come soon.
